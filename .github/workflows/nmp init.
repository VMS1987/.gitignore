Initialize an npm package with npm init. In the package initialization wizard, enter your package with the name: @YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY, and set the test script to exit 0. This will generate a package.json file with information about your package.

$ npm init
  ...
  package name: @YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY

  test command: exit 0
